## Schema

### Required

- `scopes` (Set of String) List of permission scopes required for the token, ex. `https://ossrdbms-aad.database.windows.net/.default` for relational databases. Although a list is supported, it's probably better to use separate tokens for separate scopes.

### Optional

- `claims` (String) Any additional claims required for the token to satisfy a conditional access policy, such as a service may return in a claims challenge following an authorization failure.
- `enable_cae` (Boolean) Indicates whether to enable Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE) for the requested token. Requires a client supporting CAE. The default is false.

### Read-Only

- `token` (String, Sensitive) Output token for required scopes
